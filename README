JWeb-Server is a fun project created in order to enhances my knowledge on how web works with http.

- **@GetApi**(url='/test'): This annotation is used to mark the method to be used as api.
- **@ApiRequestParam**(key='param'): This annotation is used along with method parameter in order to map query key-value pair.
